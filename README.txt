DATA AVAILABILITY
Data described in the manuscript are available upon formal application to and approval by the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. To ensure the confidentiality and privacy of cohort participants, written request for access to the data is required. The standard procedure for controlled access requires that applications to use the resources of the Nurses' Health Studies and Health Professionals Follow-up Study undergo a formal review by the cohort committee. The committee assesses the scientific aims, examines the suitability of the proposed methodology for the available data, and confirms that the proposed use aligns with the guidelines of the Ethics and Governance Framework. Further information including the procedures to obtain and access data from the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study is described at https://www.nurseshealthstudy.org/researchers (email: nhsaccess@channing.harvard.edu) and https://sites.sph.harvard.edu/hpfs/for-collaborators/.
